# It's a todo list

Everyone has one, but can everyone create one with computer code?

I am going to find out the question to that myself with my first C# and XAML program. 

I will be using a SQLite DB to store my todo items.

This is a learning exercise, so I am looking forward to it. Wish me luck!
